                  <p>Animation has always been a critical component of rethinking the stability and politics of the moving image and recorded sound. How might it unpredict or undo the future, critically deform the past, and reinvent the present? This conference seeks interrogations into the temporalities of animation, the past/present/future of animation practices, the spatial locations of its creation and study, and the orientations of animation theory and practice. </p>
